# C++ Traits Quiz

This directory contains an interactive quiz to help you review and master C++ traits programming concepts.

## Files

- `traits_quiz.cpp` - The main quiz file with blanks to fill in
- `traits_quiz_answers.cpp` - Complete answer key with explanations
- `README.md` - This instruction file

## How to Use

### 1. Take the Quiz
1. Open `traits_quiz.cpp` in your preferred text editor
2. Fill in the blanks marked with `_____`
3. Complete the missing code sections
4. Try to compile and run your solution:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o traits_quiz traits_quiz.cpp
   ./traits_quiz
   ```

### 2. Check Your Answers
1. Compare your solutions with `traits_quiz_answers.cpp`
2. Run the answer key to see the expected output:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o traits_quiz_answers traits_quiz_answers.cpp
   ./traits_quiz_answers
   ```

### 3. Learning Objectives

By completing this quiz, you will understand:

- **Template Specialization**: How to create specialized versions of templates for specific types
- **Type Traits**: Compile-time type information and testing
- **SFINAE**: Substitution Failure Is Not An Error principles
- **Detection Idioms**: Using `std::void_t` and modern C++ techniques
- **Type Transformation**: Modifying types at compile time
- **Container Traits**: Detecting type capabilities and interfaces

## Topics Covered

### Section 1: Basic Template Traits
Learn how to declare and specialize template traits for different types.

### Section 2: Type Checking Traits
Create traits that test type properties (like pointer detection).

### Section 3: SFINAE and Enable_if
Use `std::enable_if` to conditionally enable template functions.

### Section 4: Container Traits
Detect if types have container-like interfaces using `std::void_t`.

### Section 5: Advanced Traits with SFINAE
Create more complex detection traits for specific member functions.

### Section 6: Value-based Traits
Work with traits that provide compile-time values (like array sizes).

### Section 7: Type Transformation Traits
Modify and clean up types using transformation traits.

## Quiz Statistics

- **Total blanks**: 50+ blank sections to complete
- **Lines of code**: ~200+ lines including tests
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced
- **Time estimate**: 1-2 hours for beginners, 30-60 minutes for experienced developers

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of C++ templates
- Familiarity with `std::type_traits` library (helpful but not required)
- C++17 compatible compiler

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with the basics**: Complete sections in order
2. **Use the compiler**: Let compilation errors guide you to the right solutions
3. **Run tests frequently**: Each section has test functions to validate your work
4. **Study the patterns**: Notice how similar techniques are used across different problems
5. **Reference documentation**: Use [cppreference.com](https://cppreference.com/) for `std::type_traits` help

## Expected Output

When your quiz is completed correctly, you should see:
```
C++ Traits Quiz - Running Tests
=================================
=== Testing Basic Traits ===

```

## Advanced Challenges

After completing the basic quiz, try these additional challenges:

1. Add support for detecting other STL container methods
2. Create traits for detecting arithmetic operators
3. Implement your own version of `std::is_arithmetic`
4. Create a trait that detects if a type is iterable with range-based for loops

Happy learning! ðŸš€
